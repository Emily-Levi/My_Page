<root> For the simplest of all slime recipes, all you need is cornstarch. Just dump some into a
    bowl, add some water, &amp; start mixing. Keep adding water until it reaches the consistency you
    want (a good place to start is 2 parts cornstarch to 1 part water). You can also add food
    coloring to make it look more legit. </root>
