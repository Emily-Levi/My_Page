  <p type="first" about="objectODevotion">
    <plant ptype="tree:">Trees</plant> and <material mtype="stone">stones</material> have long been
    objects of deep devotion in <place>Japan</place>. Originally there were no shrine buildings;
    instead a <plant ptype="tree">tree</plant>, <plant ptype="forest">forest</plant>, or a large
      <material mtype="boulder">boulder</material> or a <landform type="mountain"
    >mountain</landform>, festooned with ropes, would be the focus of worship.</p>
  <p type="second" about="creatMonoke">In Japan the mysterious forces of nature, called
        <emph><foreign language="japenese"> ke</foreign></emph>, were believed to permeate palpable
    matter and formless space (collectively called mono in Japanese) to create <emph><foreign
        language="japenese"> mononoke</foreign></emph>. Mononoke was seen to coalesce in <plant
      ptype="tree">trees</plant> and <material type="stone">stones</material>. Certain
      <plant>trees</plant>, especially the cryptomeria and the <plant ptype="tree"
      Sub-type="evergreen">evergreen</plant>
    <emph><foreign language="japenese"> sakaki</foreign></emph>, were considered sacred for this
    reason. When one of these <plant ptype="tree">trees</plant> was felled and the <material
      mtype="wood">wood</material> used in the construction of a shrine, this sacred quality was
    believed to follow it into the building. The sacred tree itself was literally and symbolically
    present in the form of a pillar or post around which the shrine was constructed</p>. <p
    type="third" about="shinto shrine"> great <place type="worship">Shinto shrine</place> at <place
      pltype="city" location="japan">Ise </place>is built amid a dense <plant type="forest"
      >forest</plant> of giant cryptomeria <plant type="tree">trees</plant> next to the <place
      location="japan" pltype="river">Isuzu River</place> at the foot of <place pltype="mountain"
      location="japan" sub-location="Mie">Mount Kamiji</place> and <place pltype="mountain"
      location="japan" sub-location="Mie">Mount Shimaji</place> in the <place pltype="Prefacure"
      location="japan">Mie Prefecture</place> [see Mie Prefecture] in southern <place pltype="island"
      location="japan">Honshu, Japan</place>. Crossing the <place location="japan"
      sub-location="KyotoPrefecture">Uji Bridge</place> and passing through the large torii gate
    marking the entrance to the shrine, a long path leads to <place pltype="shinre" sybolism="worship"
      location="japan" sub-location="ise">Ise Jingu </place>(Ise Grand Shrine).</p>
  <p type="fourth" about="shrine composition"> The shrine consists of two groups of buildings: the
      <place pltype="shirne" sybolism="worship" location="japan" sub-location="Ise">Imperial
      Shrine</place>
    <place pltype="shrine" location="japan" sub-location="ise">(Kotai Jingu)</place>, also known as
    the <place pltype="shirne" sybolism="worship" location="japan" sub-location="Ise">Naiku</place>
    (inner shrine), and the <place pltype="shirne" sybolism="worship" location="japan"
      sub-location="Ise">Toyouke Shrine</place>
    <emph><foreign language="japenese">(Toyouke Daijingu )</foreign></emph> which constitutes the
        <emph><foreign language="japenese"> Geku</foreign></emph> or outer shrine. The
        <emph><foreign language="japenese"> Naiku </foreign></emph> is dedicated to the Sun Goddess
        <emph><foreign language="japenese">Amaterasu Omikami </foreign>
      <translation>(Heaven-Illuminating Great Deity)</translation></emph>, and the <emph><foreign
        language="japenese"> Geku</foreign></emph>to the Goddess of Cereals <emph><foreign
        language="japenese"> Toyouke Omikami </foreign>
      <translation>(Abundant Food Great Deity)</translation></emph>. Each shrine is composed of a
    number of buildings, including ancillary shrines, workshops, storehouses, etc. Each shrine has
    an inner precinct with a main sanctuary and two attendant shrines, as well as treasuries,
    fences, and gates.</p>
  <p type="fifth" about="shrineconstruction"> Both shrines are constructed of <material mtype="wood"
      >wood</material>, and every <time tn="20" tu="years">twenty years</time> both are totally
    rebuilt on an adjoining site. <translation>The empty site of the previous shrine</translation>
    (called the <emph><foreign language="japenese">kodenchi</foreign></emph>) is strewn with large
    white pebbles. The only building on the empty site, which retains its sacredness for the
    intervening <years tn="twenty">twenty years</years>, is a small wooden shed or hut <emph><foreign
        language="japenese">(oi-ya)</foreign></emph> inside of which is a post about seven feet high
    known as <emph><foreign language="japenese">shin-no-mihashira </foreign> (<translation>literally
        the august column of the heart, or more freely translated as sacred central
        post)</translation></emph>. The new shrine will be erected over and around this post which
    are the holiest and most mysterious objects in the <place pltype="shrine" symbolism="worship"
      location="Japan" sub-loaction="ise">Ise Shrine</place>. They remain hidden at all times.</p>
  <p rype="sixth" about="quote"><person>Kenzo Tange</person> and <person>Noboru Kawazoe</person> (p.
    167, see Bibliography below) suggest that: <quote><sybolism>the erection of a single post in the
        center of a sacred area strewn with stones represents the form taken by Japanese places of
        worship in very ancient times; the shin-no-mihashira would thus be the survival of a
        symbolism from a very pimitive symbolism to the present day.</sybolism>
      <thebuild>The present buildings reproduce the temple first ceremoniously rebuilt in<year
          timeperiod="Common Era"> 692 CE</year> by <person>Empress Jito</person>. The first temple
        had been built by her husband <person>Emperor Temmu </person>(678-686), the first Mikado to
        rule over a united <place>Japan</place></thebuild>
    </quote>.</p>
  <p type="seventh" about="vryptomeria"><person>Emperor Temmu</person> had established Ise as the
    principal cult shrine of <place>Imperial Japan,</place> but the site itself, and the cryptomeria
    trees that grew on it, were already sacred before then. The cryptomeria is a <plant>tree</plant>
    associated with <place pltype="shrine" symbolism="worship" location="japan" sub-loaction="ise"
      >Shinto shrines</place>. The principal sacred plant of <place pltype="shrine" location="jaoan"
      >Shinto</place>, however, is the <emph><foreign language="japenese"> sakaki </foreign>
        (<translation>a shrub related to the tea bush)</translation></emph>. The shin-no-mihashira
    is taken to represent a branch of the <emph><foreign language="japenese"> sakaki
      </foreign></emph> stuck upright in the ground.</p>
  <p type="eighth" about="chambers">The chambers of the shrines are raised on <material
      mtype="timber">timber</material>
    <description>piles which themselves are analogous to the central sacred post. The roof is not
      supported by the walls (although the rafters do rest on purlins), but the ridge beam is
      carried instead by two large columns at either end which embedded directly into the ground
      without any foundation.</description></p>
  <p type="ninth" about="otherShrines">Besides <plant>trees</plant>, at the<place pltype="shrine"
      symbolism="worship" location="Japan" sub-location="ise"> Ise Shrine</place> are many
    subsidiary shrines of <materials type="rock">rocks</materials> from the sea which are regarded
    as the abodes (<emph><foreign language="japenese">iwakura </foreign></emph>or rock abodes) of
    deities.</p>
